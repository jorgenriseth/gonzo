    "# Concentration Maps\n",

    "We will assume that you've already registered the $T_1$-maps from both the [Look-Locker](./looklocker-processing.ipynb) and [Mixed](./mixed-t1map-processing.ipynb) sequences, and that you have created brain segmentations using the [FreeSurfer/FastSurfer](./free-fast-surfer.ipynb) pipeline.\n",

    "The steps include:\n",
